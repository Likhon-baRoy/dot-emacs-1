narendraj9's dot-emacs 
=====================================

My Emacs configuration.


Setup
-----

If you would like to try it, use the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/narendraj9/dot-emacs.git" "~/Downloads/dot-emacs"
$ emacs -Q -l "~/Downloads/dot-emacs/init.el"

```

The above commands should not affect your existing Emacs
configuration.

The first time you start Emacs with this configuration, it would try
to install all the packages from Melpa, which will take some time.
